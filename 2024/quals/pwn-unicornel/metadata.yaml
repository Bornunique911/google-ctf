# Long form description.
description: |+
  I wrote this super cool emulator
  Above all the others, I'm quite sure it is greater
  There are many bells and whistles galore
  The quality of which I know you'll adore
  Coolest of all are all the syscalls
  The implementations of which are surely high-qual
  Because of this I would stipulate
  That from this emulator there is no escape
