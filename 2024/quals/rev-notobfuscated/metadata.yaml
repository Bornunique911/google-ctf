  True story: I had planned on learning to write LLVM passes
  and use them for obfuscation for this year's gCTF challenge.
  However, when I compiled this code with optimizations enabled,
  I decided I didn't need to write an obfuscator.

  It's a crackme, you know the drill. GL HF! 

  Note: The challenge outputs the flag in the wrong format, instead of "ctf{", use "CTF{" when submitting the flag.
# The flag
flag: CTF{I_pr0mize_its_jUsT_mAtriCeS}
